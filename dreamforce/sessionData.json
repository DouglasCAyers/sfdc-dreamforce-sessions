        "sessionAbstract": "Some people may think that supply chain resiliency programs are something only very large enterprises invest in. They’re the ones with thousands of suppliers, many years of established supply chain practices and complex operations stretching to every corner of the globe. By default, they must be the ones exposed to greater risk, the common thinking sometimes goes. But, that’s not the case. Most companies with growing supply chains aren’t immune to supply chain disruptions or their impact. They face many of the same concerns bigger companies do. It’s the nature of business today–complexity and risk are inherent challenges all companies need to manage, internally or with third-party support. Customers are demanding greater transparency into supply chains since any disruption to the flow of goods can severely impact financial performance and the brand of the company. This session will discuss how you can quickly build a more resilient supply chain.",

But the new book from CEB, The Effortless Experience, uses over five years of research and tens of thousands of respondents to reveal that the “dazzle factor” is wildly overrated. Consider this: what do customers really want from their cable company, a free month of HBO when they make a mistake, or a fast, painless restoration of your connection? Most customers don’t want to be “wowed”; they want an effortless experience. In this enlightening session, Matthew Dixon, executive director at CEB, will explain how a company’s ability to deliver on basic promises and solve day-to-day problems drives customer loyalty. Beyond explaining these findings, this session will share how companies have reduced customer effort from management and frontline reps, along with the results they've achieved.",

Today we have a large and growing inventory of digital tools for generating revenue in either the B2B, B2C, or even the B2B2C realms. In a few cases, sales model can be built that exclusively use a digital revenue engine, however, the vast majority of organizations will be combining the best of what humans do (build trust, sense emotion, creativity) with what technology can provide (scalability, repeatability, and lower costs.) Humalogy based selling is the concept of re-architecting revenue engines to best utilize tools like CRM, automated marketing systems, social listening systems in combination with a human connection where needed. Get this recipe right and you will be able to build closer customer relationships and have more influence over them. Get it wrong, and you will slowly fade from relevance. Scott Klososky consults with many organizations to design the upgrades to their sales and marketing systems and will share concepts, ideas, and stories from the front lines.

In the rush to embrace a customer adoption charter, many traditional support organizations are being rebranded as “success” organizations. In other cases, new success organizations are being created to stand beside the traditional support organization. Often, the lines of demarcation are fuzzy. They can also be fertile ground for internal turf wars. \n\nHow do you know if you have truly crossed the line from “support” to “success?” TSIA believes that customer success is really not an organization, but a broad capability, and that the supporting capabilities for customer success will be found in multiple organizations. In this session, TSIA will explore:\nWhat capabilities are truly unique to the customer success function?\nWhat capabilities that support customer success already exist in a typical technology company?\nHow does a company migrate from “support” to “support and success?”",

Alternatively, the best companies approach customer consensus with a completely different perspective altogether, designed not just to better connect individual customer stakeholders to them, but ultimately to better connect those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. Join Brent Adamson, Managing Director at CEB for a deep dive into the strategies to create and drive consensus to deliver the highest revenues.",

This includes Comcast partners, such as Best Buy and Walmart. XSRs are always on-the-go and need to have real-time access to store information, perform store surveys and capture sales activities. Xfinity Sales Management requires clear visibility into the sales performance at both the store and Rep/Team level. Our solution includes Salesforce1 as the platform to configure the sales process for the indirect sales channel, and all users and stores are migrated over to the platform. The Salesforce1 Mobile App is used to provide mobile access to the XSRs in the field. The mobile solution leverages Salesforce1 enabled apps from the AppExchange (MapAnything and SurveyForms) to provide mapping capabilities for the XSRs and enables them to perform surveys during store visits.",

Fast forward 15 years and we are finding that customer service is more than handling problems. This session will analyze the current trends and issues in the world of customer service – from technologies to business integrations and more. \n\nThe session will discuss:\n• How service is moving to proactive, where no service is the best service possible\n• What are the advantages of one-way (Amazon Mayday) and two-way video support\n• How can communities, groups, social networks, and forums take service out of the organization and let customers help each other\n• Is there a strategic value to investing in service beyond saving money? (Hint: yes!)\n• What is the future of service and customer interactions going to bring, and how Customer Service will lead that paradigm shift.\n• How the Internet of Things and smarter devices will change service forever – and for the best!\n\nWe will have plenty of case studies, examples, and use cases as well as lessons learned and best practices. You will leave this session with a clear vision of where Service is heading.",
